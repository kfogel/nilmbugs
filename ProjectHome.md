**`nilmbugs`** is based on the [mediabugs-open](http://code.google.com/p/mediabugs-open) code that runs [MediaBugs.org](http://mediabugs.org/), which in turn is based on the excellent [PeoplePods](http://peoplepods.net) PHP library by [Ben Brown](http://xoxco.com).  The **`nilmbugs`** code is purposely kept in Subversion at Google Code Hosting under an MIT license to match how **`mediabugs-open`** is published.
