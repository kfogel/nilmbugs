         National Inventory of Legal Materials (NILM) Bug Tracker
         ========================================================

This is the source distribution for the NILM Bug Tracker.  The project
home is http://code.google.com/p/nilmbugs.  For more information about
NILM, see http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/09/lawgov-update-1.html.

NILMBugs is based on the MediaBugs.org tracker, which in turn uses the
PeoplePods.net library developed by Ben Brown.

Installation Overview
=====================

  When you run the installation instructions below, a new directory
  also named 'nilmbugs' gets created here.  The mediabugs-open tree is
  checked out into it, and mediabugs-open in turn checks out the
  PeoplePods library.  The deployment script also does some symlinking
  to make sure some PHP code can find other PHP code.  When all is
  said and done, the live web site is run out of the lower 'nilmbugs'
  subdirectory (so if the current directory is named 'nilmbugs' too,
  as is likely, then you'll have nilmbugs/nilmbugs/.htaccess, etc.)

Installation Instructions
=========================

  1. Run 'make deploy'.

  2. Follow the instructions in ./nilmbugs/README, but with these
     differences: 

       a) Serve the live web site from nilmbugs/nilmbugs here.  In
          other words, you'll probably have to add one extra level of
          "/nilmbugs" to the path, in the obvious way.

       b) When activating pods, make sure to also turn on the
          'lgviolation' pod.

       c) Where it says to choose the "MediaBugs" theme, choose
          the "NILM Bugs" theme instead. 

  3. Run the 'seed-db' script in the current directory to create the
     ten objects representing Law.Gov Principles.

        ==> alternatively ==>

     You could create them by hand, to learn the web-based admin
     interface for adding content.  Below is how.  (But skip the rest
     of this step if you just ran 'seed-db' above.)

     Assuming you're still in the "/peoplepods" admin screens:

     In the upper left vertical nav panel, click on "Content",
     then at the top of the resultant page, click "Add Content".

     It will ask you "What type of content would you like to create?"
     Click on the "Create" button next to the faded grey letters
     saying "new content type" (there's no point actually entering the
     content type here; we'll do it on the next page).

     On the resultant page, in the upper right where it says "new
     content type Change", click "Change" and enter "lgviolation".
     This will be the type for all 10 Law.Gov Violation objects.

     (NOTE: You will *not* be manually entering that type name again.
     Although we're about to enter the first of ten Law.Gov violation
     objects, the remaining 2-10 will be created by clicking on the
     now-existent type from the Add Content page.)

     The rest of this needs to be done 10 times.  Let's walk through
     the first time:

     Enter a headline, like "Access fees (Law.Gov #1)".
     For the body, I'd say switch to HTML mode and then enter some
     text like:

       <p>Direct fees for dissemination of primary legal materials
       should be avoided.</p> 
       <p><a href="http://public.resource.org/law.gov"
       >public.resource.org/law.gov</a>

     Hit "Save", then lather, rinse, repeat, starting from "Add Content.
     BUT, from now on, just click on "Lgviolation" after "Add Content",
     since we've now created the type and can re-use it for more objects.

     To save time: when entering the headlines and descriptions, you
     can cut and paste from the 'law-gov.txt' file included here.  The
     headlines and HTML bodies are all written out there.
