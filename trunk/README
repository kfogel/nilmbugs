         National Inventory of Legal Materials (NILM) Bug Tracker
         ========================================================

This is the source distribution for the NILM Bug Tracker.  The project
home is http://code.google.com/p/nilmbugs.  For more information about
NILM, see http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/09/lawgov-update-1.html.

NILMBugs is based on the MediaBugs.org tracker, which in turn uses the
PeoplePods.net library developed by Ben Brown.

Installation Overview
=====================

  When you run the installation instructions below, a new directory
  'mediabugs-open' is created here and the mediabugs-open tree is
  checked out into it (mediabugs-open in turn fetches the PeoplePods
  library).  Then some symlinking happens so various PHP code can find
  other PHP code.  When it's all over, the live web site runs out of
  this directory, and some stuff under mediabugs-open is reached via
  symlinks that the deployment script set up.

Installation Instructions
=========================

  1. Run 'make deploy'.

  2. Follow the instructions in ./nilmbugs/README, but with these
     (fairly self-explanatory) differences: 

       a) Use 'nilmbugs' for the database name and user 'nilmbugsrw',
          instead of 'mediabugs' / 'mediabugsrw'.

       b) Serve the live web site from the current directory (i.e.,
          the directory this README is in).

       c) When activating pods, make sure to also turn on the
          'lgviolation' pod.

       d) Where it says to choose the "MediaBugs" theme, choose
          the "NILM Bugs" theme instead. 

  3. Run the 'seed-db' script in the current directory to create the
     ten objects representing Law.Gov Principles.

        ==> alternatively ==>

     You could create them by hand, to learn the web-based admin
     interface for adding content.  Below is how.  (But skip the rest
     of this step if you just ran 'seed-db' above.)

     Assuming you're still in the "/peoplepods" admin screens:

     In the upper left vertical nav panel, click on "Content",
     then at the top of the resultant page, click "Add Content".

     It will ask you "What type of content would you like to create?"
     Click on the "Create" button next to the faded grey letters
     saying "new content type" (there's no point actually entering the
     content type here; we'll do it on the next page).

     On the resultant page, in the upper right where it says "new
     content type Change", click "Change" and enter "lgviolation".
     This will be the type for all 10 Law.Gov Violation objects.

     (NOTE: You will *not* be manually entering that type name again.
     Although we're about to enter the first of ten Law.Gov violation
     objects, the remaining 2-10 will be created by clicking on the
     now-existent type from the Add Content page.)

     The rest of this needs to be done 10 times.  Let's walk through
     the first time:

     Enter a headline, like "Access fees (Law.Gov #1)".
     For the body, I'd say switch to HTML mode and then enter some
     text like:

       <p>Direct fees for dissemination of primary legal materials
       should be avoided.</p> 
       <p><a href="http://public.resource.org/law.gov"
       >public.resource.org/law.gov</a>

     Hit "Save", then lather, rinse, repeat, starting from "Add Content.
     BUT, from now on, just click on "Lgviolation" after "Add Content",
     since we've now created the type and can re-use it for more objects.

     To save time: when entering the headlines and descriptions, you
     can cut and paste from the 'law-gov.txt' file included here.  The
     headlines and HTML bodies are all written out there.
